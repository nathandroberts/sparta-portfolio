## Feedback  

#### Difficult to implement

The most difficult thing to implement was the removal and re-appearance of certain elements depending on the window size (possible due to interactions with !important tags in bootstrap).

#### Most pleased with

I am most pleased with the use of bootstrap (particularly for formatting) as it allowed me to style elements in a more time efficient manner than if i had formatted them manually. I also tried to stick to the main brief at first as instructed rather than try to implement complex new features which allowed me to produce a more complete site in the timespan.
